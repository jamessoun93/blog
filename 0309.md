# Same Origin Policy

Protocol: `https://`  
Host: `www.google.com`  
Port: `:443`

www.wikipedia.org 에서 아래 세가지 경우는 어떻게 처리될까?

1. A JavaScript GET request to www.bank.com.

2. A JavaScript POST request to www.bank.com.

3. Clicking an HTML link to a video on www.bank.com.

4. This request will FAIL, because requests to get information from a cross-origin domain are not allowed by the browser. The browser is trying to protect your privacy by preventing www.wikipedia.org from stealing your private information from www.bank.com.

5. This request will SUCCEED. This is a little known exception to the Same Origin Policy! The decision to allow POST requests is mostly historical, but there is also a lower chance that a POST request will steal your private information. POST requests are used to write data to a server, rather than GET data from it, so it's less likely the response will contain private information.

6. This request will SUCCEED. The Same Origin Policy applies only to scripts and not static resources like HTML tags.
